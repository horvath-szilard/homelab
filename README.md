# Homelab

This repository contains my own homelab setup, which demonstrates how I work, what I'm doing and it may be a learning path for someone else starting their career or changing their roles.

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Hey, I'm SzilÃ¡rd. I live in KÅ‘szeg, Hungary and I'm working in IT for 9+ years. I've created this repository for multiple purposes. I wanted to showcase my knowledge and interest when I apply for jobs and I'm also trying to learn new things all the time. You may be in the middle of finding a way to build your cool homelab and now you're here. Feel free to contact me if you have questions.
